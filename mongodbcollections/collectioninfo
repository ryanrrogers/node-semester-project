 Thes collections can be modified based on app requirements.   accounts = user schema
 In Mongodb on my desktop I created a dbs = APWposts 
 Admin user account =  apwadmin .  The admin user account is at the database level not within the accounts/user collection 
 
 >use APWposts
 switched to db APWposts
 >db
 APWposts
 >show collections
 accounts
 posts
 thread
 >db.createUser(
 {user:"apwadmin",
 pwd:"apwaccount",
 roles["readWrite"]
 }
 )
 
 
  db.getUsers()
[
        {
                "_id" : "APWposts.apwadmin",
                "userId" : UUID("7972c2af-4460-4e6e-bcfb-fe106fbb0611"),
                "user" : "apwadmin",
                "db" : "APWposts",
                "roles" : [
                        {
                                "role" : "readWrite",
                                "db" : "APWposts"
                        }
                ],
                "mechanisms" : [
                        "SCRAM-SHA-1",
                        "SCRAM-SHA-256"
                ]
        }
]
